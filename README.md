# HOW TO EXECUTE THE PROGRAM
While executing the problem, 
- Enter the first matrix elements from left to right progressing through the rows one by one.
- Enter the second matrix elements from top to bottom progressing through the columns one by one.

# FUTURE
- This is raw code. It returns raw output. I haven't learnt a lot in JAVA yet. I'll re - upload a new program within DEC'24 with a fully functional code with visualizations and a working application.
